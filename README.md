Picnic - Algorithmic Score Art

Composed and Coded by Andrew Scott Israelsen.
August 2014 - March 2015.

An ongoing, ever-expanding system of algorithmic and generative score art for use in music, performance, 
installation, and invention. Intended to allow infinite variation, there is no limit to the scope and possibilities
for Picnic. Performers and creators are welcome to add their own images to manipulate, and to generate their 
own version of the score of any scale.

Currently, there is significant work being done to finish picnic_v1.pde and its related sketches. Updates include 
GUI control, a newly rewritten image loader, more flexible image rendering, new filters and manipulations, and
more file output support, and a sketch for generating .pdf files.

To use this code, visit processing.org and download Processing v2.0.

Download all the sketches and the source images and place in the same folder.
The sketches should go in the parent directory of the folder, and all of the source images should
be placed in a folder called 'data'.
